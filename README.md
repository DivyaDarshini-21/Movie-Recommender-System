# Movie-Recommender-System

With the development of technology, our habits are also changing. Instead of shopping from stores, we buy our needs through e-commerce, we watch Netflix instead of watching TV or listen to music on Spotify. 

One of the reasons why these companies are so popular can be shown that their business structures are based on recommendation systems. 

If you have noticed, Netflix offers you special movie / series recommendations instead of just your own TV show / music preferences.

In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset and The Movies dataset
